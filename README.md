#Odin Recipes

This is the initial practice project of The Odin Project web development course.
It serves for demonstration of elementary HTML skills:
creating basic HTML page with headings, paragraphs, lists, links to other pages and images.

Website consists of main page that contains list of links to three other web pages,
each of which presents one cooking recipe for some of my favorite meals.
