        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>For this satisfying dish, cabbage leaves are stuffed with a seasoned mixture of rice, ground beef, pork and ham. 
            They are then laid on a bed of sauerkraut and simmered to completion. 
            This is the best stuffed cabbage recipe I've ever tried.</p>
        
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 large head cabbage</li>
            <li>1 pound lean ground beef</li>
            <li>1/2 pound ground pork</li>
            <li>1/2 pound ground ham</li>
            <li>1 cup uncooked long-grain white rice</li>
            <li>1 onion, finely chopped</li>
            <li>1 egg</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon coarse ground black pepper</li>
            <li>1 pound sauerkraut</li>
            <li>1 cup tomato juice</li>
            <li>water to cover</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Place cabbage in the freezer for a few days. The night before making the rolls, take it out to thaw.</li>
            <li>In a large bowl, combine the beef, pork, ham, rice, onion, egg, garlic powder, salt and pepper. Mix well. 
                Form meat mixture into oblong balls, using 1/2 cup of the mixture at a time. Then, wrap a cabbage leaf around each ball.</li>
            <li>Spread the sauerkraut in the bottom of a large pot, then layer cabbage rolls on top, placing them seam-side down. 
                Pour tomato juice over rolls, then add enough water to cover. 
                Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to low and simmer for about 3 hours, adding more water as necessary.</li>
        </ol>
